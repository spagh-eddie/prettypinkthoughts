Leviticus 26:3-13
=================

    (The Lord said to Moses at Mount Sinai) "If you follow my decrees, ...
    I will send you rain, ... you will eat all the food you want, ...
    I will grant peace in the land, ...
    You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you....
    I will look on you with favor and make you fruitful and increase your numbers."

Love Note
---------

    Loved one,

    My offer still stands.
    If you obey me, I will bless you, give you peace, dwell with you, walk with you and be your God!

    --- Your eternal Father

Commentary
----------

Chapter 26 is a half page of the "Reward for Obedience" followed by a page and a half of the "Punishment for Disobedience."
This Love Note focuses on the reward but the text's own emphasis seems to be on the punishment.
The following three quarters of the chapter, verses 14-40, include:

    "But if you will not listen to me....
    I will send wild animals against you, and they will rob you of your children....
    You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters....
    I will turn your cities into ruins and lay waste your sanctuaries....
    Your enemies will devour you.
    Those of you who are left will waste away."
