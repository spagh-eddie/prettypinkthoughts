Leviticus 16:3-5
================

    [Aaron] must first bring a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
    He is to put on the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments next to his body;
    he is to tie the linen sash around him and put on the linen turban...
    [H]e is to take two male goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.

Truth or Dare
-------------

    What steps do you take to get ready for a special occasion?
    Meeting with God involves a similar *internal* preparation.
    Before you pray, take time to humble your mind, body, and spirit.

Commentary
----------

While I agree with the notion of humbling oneself, I disagree that the text here intends this interpretation.

Firstly, I don't see how animal sacrifice is related to humbling oneself.

Secondly, I find it difficult to imagine that wearing clothes of gold and expensively dyed threads bearing precious stones set in gold and hung by gold chains (Ex 28:4-43) "humbles the body."
Quite the opposite, the clothes are said to give Aaron "dignity and honor" (Ex 28:40).

Of note: Aaron was ordered to wear these clothes with the alarming phrase "so that he will not die" (Ex 28:35,43).
