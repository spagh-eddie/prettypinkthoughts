Leviticus 23:1-4
================

    (The Lord said to Moses) "There are six days when you may work, but the seventh is a day of sabbath rest...
    You are not to do any work."

Truth or Dare
-------------

    Who says following Christ is all work and no play?
    God wants us all to relax and enjoy life so much that he scheduled weekly breaks and yearly celebrations!

Commentary
----------

I don't see where it is said that God did this so we could "relax and enjoy life."
Indeed, it may be difficult to relax if told to do so under threat of death:

    A man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day....
    The Lord said to Moses, "The man must die.
    The whole assembly must stone him outside the camp."
    So the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the Lord commanded Moses.

    --- Numbers 15:32-36
