Leviticus 20:10-21
==================

    | (The Lord said to Moses) "If a man commits adultery with another man's wife... both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death....
    | If a man has sexual relations with a man... both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death....
    | If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he is to be put to death, and you must kill the animal.
    | If a woman approaches an animal to have sexual relations with it, kill both the woman and the animal....
    | If a marries his sister, the daughter of either his father or his mother, and they have sexual relations, it is a disgrace.
    | If a man has sexual relations with a woman during her monthly period... Both of them are to be cut off from their people."

Truth or Dare
-------------

    God's punishments for sexual sins seems harsh by today's standards.
    However, these laws show God's deep concern for preserving our most intimate relationship.

Commentary
----------

I agree that killing gay men "seems harsh."
But why do they say "seems"?

How does killing raped animals show "deep concern"?

Of note is that men are not to marry half-sisters ("the daughter of *either* his father *or* his mother"), but Abraham married his half-sister (Gen 20:12) and God intervened to give them a child.

How does prohibiting sex while a woman is on her period "preserve our most intimate relationship"?
