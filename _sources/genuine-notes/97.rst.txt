Exodus 22:22-27
===============

    (The Lord said to Moses)
    "Do not take advantage of the widow or the fatherless.
    If you do and they cry out to me, I will certainly hear their cry.
    My anger will be aroused, and I will kill you with the sword; your wives will become widows and your children fatherless.
    If you lend money [to the needy], charge no interest.
    If you take your neighbor's cloak as a pledge, return it by sunset...
    When they cry out to me, I will hear, for I am compassionate."

Genuine Compassion
------------------

    Notice God's concern for these people: widows, the fatherless and the needy.
    They've had extra pain in life, so God tells us to show them extra compassion.
    Look around you.
    Who's hurting in your school or church?
    A friend whose parents are getting divorced?
    An acquaintance who just lost a loved one?
    A girl who sits by herself because she doesn't have any friends?
    Got tells us to seek these people out.
    Their wounds are raw, and their hearts are needy, so we're to show them extra love.
    God always looks out for the underdog.
    Do you?

Commentary
----------

This annotation is quite endearing.

However, it is interesting to note that in the text, "concern for the widows" involves creating more widows by becoming angry and killing "with the sword.""
