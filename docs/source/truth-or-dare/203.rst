Numbers 33:55
=============

    (The Lord said to Moses) "if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides.
    They will give you trouble in the land where you live."

Truth or Dare
-------------

    Even though splinters are tiny, they can be painful and annoying.
    Sin affects you in the same way â€“ if it's not removed right away, it gets worse and worse.

Commentary
----------

One can most certainly say that of splinters, but the splinters are a metaphor for people.
The Truth or Dare supports a literal ethnic cleansing: "drive out the inhabitants... [d]\ :spelling:ignore:`estroy` all their carved images... demolish all their high places... [and t]\ :spelling:ignore:`ake` possession of the land"\ [#]_ (v. 52-54).

Moreover, if the Israelites do not destroy the Canaanites, the Lord threatens "I will do to [the Israelites] what I plan to do to [the Canaanites]" (v. 56).
