Exodus 23:4-5
=============

    (The Lord said to Moses)
    "If you come across your enemy's ox or donkey, be sure to return it.
    If you see the donkey of someone who hates you fallen down under its load, do not leave it there; be sure you help them with it."

Truth or Dare
-------------

    Taking revenge never ends a fight.
    Your actions will only make the other girl *angrier*.
    Instead, work to *heal* a broken relationship by helping her in an unexpected way.

Commentary
----------

While the annotation does provide a good solution, another solution given is to get rid of both the enemy and their livestock.
Then you would not have to worry about them being angrier.

    [Y]\ :spelling:ignore:`ou` must certainly put to the sword all who live in that town [that worships other gods].
    You are to destroy it completely, both its people and its livestock.

    --- Deuteronomy 13:15
