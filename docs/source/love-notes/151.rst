    Loved one,

    My offer still stands.
    If you obey me, I will bless you, give you peace, dwell with you, walk with you and be your God!

Commentary
----------

Chapter 26 is a half page of the "Reward for Obedience" followed by a page and a half of the "Punishment for Disobedience."
This Love Note focuses on the reward but the text's own emphasis seems to be on the punishment.
Verses 3-13 include:

    (The Lord said to Moses at Mount Sinai), "If you follow my decrees, ...
    I will send you rain, ... you will eat all the food you want, ...
    I will grant peace in the land, ...
    You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you."

And of course, the always-euphemistic:

    "I will look on you with favor and make you fruitful and increase your numbers."

In contrast, the following three quarters of the chapter state:

    "But if you will not listen to me, ...
    I will do this to you: I will bring on you sudden terror, wasting diseases and fever that will destroy your sight and sap your strength...
    I will multiply your afflictions... as your sins deserve.
    I will send wild animals against you, and they will rob you of your children...
    I will be hostile toward you... I will send a plague among you...
    I myself will punish you...
    You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters... and pile your dead bodies on the lifeless forms of your idols, and I will abhor you.
    I will turn your cities into ruins and lay waste your sanctuaries...
    I myself will lay waste the land...
    Your land will be laid waste, and your cities will lie in ruins...
    Your enemies will devour you.
    Those of you who are left will waste away."
