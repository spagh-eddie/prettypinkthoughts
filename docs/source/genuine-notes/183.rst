Numbers 20:1-13
===============

    The Lord said to Moses,
    "Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together.
    Speak to the rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water...."

    Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff.
    Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank.

Genuine Obedience
-----------------

    It can be tough to react God's way *every* time in a tough situation.
    Like *always* being nice to your annoying brother, or *always* responding with grace when people put you down for being a Christian.
    Sometimes it would feel so good to just explode!
    But take a lesson from Moses: You'll pay for it when you do things your way instead of God's.
    Moses' whole future changed with his decision to strike the rock in anger rather than speak to it as God instructed.
    The cost of your decisions might be a broken relationship or a damaged reputation.
    Whatever it is, it's not worth it.

Commentary
----------

While the annotation blames Moses because he decided "to strike the rock," he was previously told to strike it:

    Moses cried out to the Lord, "What am I to do?...."

    The Lord answered Moses, "Go out in front of the people...
    Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink."

    --- Exodus 17:4-6
