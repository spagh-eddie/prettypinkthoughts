# prettypinkthoughts

This project is intended to document and manage my various thoughts and notes while reading my pretty pink book.
I focus mainly on the annotations in the book, not on the content of the NIV itself.
However, of course, to discuss the annotations I must also talk about the NIV.

This project is not intended to cause offense to any one or any religion.
I am neither disclosing my religious views nor any religious affiliation or non-affiliation I may have.
I hope they are irrelevant to the thoughts at hand.

## the pretty pink book

I obtained from a dear friend their monogrammed 2012 copy of *NIV True Images: The Bible for Teen Girls* by Zondervan.
It is now mine.
It is pink.
Pink is my favorite color.

The pretty pink book contains the text of the NIV and many annotations, including what they call
120 *In Focus Articles*,
500 *Truth or Dare Notes*,
100 *Love Notes from God*,
300 *Genuine Notes*,
and 52 *Mirror Images Profiles*.
